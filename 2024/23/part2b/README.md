# Ridiculous

Why am I writing code without thinking it through?  I don't think I should be
watching youtube videos while I do this puzzle :)

I can't remove one and process the remaining recursively, I don't get any new
information that way.  I should start with one and build up from there.

So take node 0 and test against each one in turn
